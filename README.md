# Streamlit-XGBoost-Classifier-App

This is an interactive streamlit app where you can hypertune all the parameters of the XGBoost Classifier.

There are different datasets to choose from and also you can vizualise how your tuned algorithm is performing.

If the accuracy is more than 90% then you also get a celeberatory balloon show.
